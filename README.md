This is a little project I had for fun to practice my skills using github, gitbash, and python's tkinter and customtkinter libraries to create a GUI which would control a peg board and using resistors and LED lights control the status of the lights. 
My pegboard contained only two lights: a multi color LED and a one color LED. The checkboxes for the Multi Light RED GREEN and BLUE control the output of the red blue green resistors giving it power when checked on. This gives an abstraction barrier between the user clicking the box and the computer sending the commands to the pegboard. The user does not need to know the commands of raspPi to turn on the lights. Below the light checkboxes are two status bars that represent the color of the LED on the pegboard.
